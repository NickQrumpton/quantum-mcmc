# 🧹 Cleanup & Organization Summary

## ✅ **What Was Done**

### **📁 Organized Into Clear Structure**
- **`organized/scripts/`** - All executable scripts by category
- **`organized/results/`** - All results and data by type  
- **`organized/documentation/`** - All guides and reports
- **`organized/src/`** - Clean source code package
- **`organized/tests/`** - All test files

## 🎯 **What to Use Now**

### **For Running Experiments:**
```bash
cd organized/scripts/hardware/
python save_ibmq_credentials.py  # Setup (once)
python run_qpe_simple.py         # Run QPE
```

### **For Viewing Results:**
```bash
ls organized/results/hardware/   # Your hardware results
ls organized/results/figures/    # Publication figures
```

### **For Documentation:**
```bash
open organized/documentation/guides/IBMQ_SETUP_GUIDE.md
```
