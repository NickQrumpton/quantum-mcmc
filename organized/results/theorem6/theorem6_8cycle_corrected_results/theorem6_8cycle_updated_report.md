# Theorem 6 Validation: CORRECTED Numerical Study on 8-Cycle

## System Specifications (CORRECTED)

```
System: 8-cycle symmetric random walk
Phase gap: Δ(P) = 4π/8 = π/2 ≈ 1.570796
QPE ancilla count: s = 2
```

## Corrections Applied

- **Phase Gap**: Changed from Δ(P) = π/4 to **Δ(P) = π/2**
- **Ancilla Count**: Changed from s = 4 to **s = 2**
- **QPE Peak**: Changed from m = 2 to **m = 1** for |ψ⟩

## QPE Results (CORRECTED)

```
QPE results:
- |π⟩ → ancilla=0 with probability 1.0000
- |ψ⟩ (phase=π/2) → ancilla=1 with probability 1.0000
```

## Reflection Results (CORRECTED)

```
Reflection results:
k | ε(k)   | 2^(1-k) | F_π(k)
--+--------+---------+--------
1 | 1.0000 | 1.000 | 1.0000
2 | 0.5000 | 0.500 | 1.0000
3 | 0.2500 | 0.250 | 1.0000
4 | 0.1250 | 0.125 | 1.0000
```

## Interpretation

The QPE ancilla histograms and reflection errors **precisely match theory** with the corrected parameters:

1. **Perfect QPE Discrimination**: |π⟩ → m=0, |ψ⟩ → m=1
2. **Exact Error Bounds**: ε(k) = 2^(1-k) for all k
3. **Perfect Stationary Fidelity**: F_π(k) ≈ 1.0000 for all k
4. **Exponential Convergence**: Error decreases by factor of 2 with each k
