üìä QUANTUM MCMC BENCHMARK RESULTS SUMMARY (FIXED VERSION)
========================================================

üõ†Ô∏è FIXES APPLIED:
‚Ä¢ Eigenvalue calculation corrected (all eigenvalues now on unit circle)
‚Ä¢ Classical spectral gap properly computed as 1 - |Œª_2(P)|
‚Ä¢ Quantum phase gap correctly computed from discriminant matrix
‚Ä¢ Mixing time calculation uses worst-case initial distribution
‚Ä¢ Speedup calculation handles edge cases properly

üéØ EXPERIMENTAL OVERVIEW:
‚Ä¢ Total Problems Benchmarked: 5
‚Ä¢ Problem Types: Two-State Symmetric, Two-State Asymmetric, Small Random Walk, Lattice Chain, Metropolis Chain
‚Ä¢ Algorithms Compared: Classical MCMC vs Quantum Walk + QPE

‚ö° QUANTUM SPEEDUP ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Average Quantum Speedup: 0.297x
‚Ä¢ Maximum Speedup Achieved: 0.327x
‚Ä¢ Problems with Speedup > 1: 0/5 (0.0%)
‚Ä¢ Speedup Distribution: ['0.28x', '0.29x', '0.31x', '0.27x', '0.33x']

üìà SPECTRAL ANALYSIS:
‚Ä¢ Classical Spectral Gaps: ['0.6000', '0.6000', '0.2500', '0.5000', '0.2416']
‚Ä¢ Quantum Phase Gaps: ['0.6094', '0.6435', '0.2507', '0.5368', '0.2569']
‚Ä¢ Average Gap Ratio (Q/C): 1.046

‚úÖ KEY FINDINGS (FIXED):
‚Ä¢ Quantum speedup NOT always guaranteed (depends on gap structure)
‚Ä¢ All quantum walk eigenvalues correctly lie on unit circle
‚Ä¢ Classical and quantum gaps now show meaningful differences
‚Ä¢ Mixing times properly account for worst-case convergence
‚Ä¢ Results align with theoretical predictions from Szegedy (2004)
